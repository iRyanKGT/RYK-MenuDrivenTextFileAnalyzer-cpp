THINK FIRST CODE LATER
 
     This proverb is intimately connected with the previous
proverbs. After you have settled on the problem definition and its
documentation procedures the essential task is to start thinking
about the solution as soon as possible and to start the actual
coding process only after you have devised a clear plan of attack.
     Consider carefully the wording of this proverb. Think first
means THINK DO NOT CODE. Start thinking while the problem is fresh
in your mind and the deadline is as far away as it will ever be.
Consider at least two different ways to solve the problem. Examine
the approaches in sufficient detail to discover possible trouble
spots or areas where the solution appears difficult. A top notch
program requires a top notch algorithm.
     CODE LATER means DELAY CODING. Give yourself some time to weed
out difficult parts and polish the algorithm before trying to
formalize it in actual code. It is much easier to discard poor
thoughts than poor programs.
     In conclusion remember Murphys second law of programming. It
always takes longer to write a program than you think. A corollary
might be the sooner you start coding the program instead of thinking
about it the longer it will take to finish the job.
